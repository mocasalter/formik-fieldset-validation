# Formik Fieldset Validation

Demo: https://formik-fieldset-validation.herokuapp.com/

A slack-like implementation of a verification code entry using Formik & React.

It checks to see if any fields in the fieldset have an error, highlights each field with an error, and shows a single error message as long as one of those fields has an error.

Other Features
* Only allows numbers to be typed
* Auto-focus change after a number is typed
* Consolidates the field values into a single string after submission
* Reset-able
* A possilbe mildly condescending success message
